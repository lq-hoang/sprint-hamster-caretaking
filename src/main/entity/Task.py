"""Entity class representing a singular task.
Tasks are generally things that should be done within a day.
An object of this class should have a record of what the task is, the date
it should be done and the ability to be "repeatable" (e.g. cage cleaning should
be done once a week, so the task should set its date to one week later once it
is complete)"""
